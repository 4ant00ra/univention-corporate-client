<title>Management, rollout and updates of UCC systems</title>
<para>
  UCC systems are rolled out via an image-based procedure. The
  recommended rollout procedure is creating the UCC systems in the
  &ucsUMC; in advance. When the image is installed, the image installation tool then
  checks whether there is already a computer account available for the
  client and uses it. If the computer name is not stored in advance,
  the name can be specified interactively during the installation.
</para>

<section id="rollout:administrationumc">
<title>Administration of UCC systems in the &ucsUMC;</title>
<para>
  UCC systems are registered and administrated with the system role
  <emphasis>Univention Corporate Client</emphasis> in the computer
  management module of the &ucsUMC;.
</para>

<para>
  In the command line frontend Univention Directory Manager, clients
  are managed with the <emphasis>computers/ucc</emphasis> module.
</para>
<para>
  The following settings must be configured for every UCC client as a minimum:
  <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara>The <emphasis>name</emphasis> of the client
	(composed of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, hyphens and
	underscores).</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>The <emphasis>MAC address</emphasis> of the
	client in the notation XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>The <emphasis>IP address</emphasis> of the client</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>

 </figure>

<para>
  A forward and reverse zone for DNS resolution should be assigned under
  <guimenu>DNS Forward and Reverse Lookup Zone</guimenu>. These zones
  are created automatically in the scope of the installation of the
  &ucsMaster;. The name and the IP address of the UCC client can thus
  also be resolved in the UCS DNS service.
</para>
<para>
  The network configuration of UCC clients is managed through DHCP in
  the default setting. A DHCP service must also be assigned under
  <guimenu>DHCP</guimenu>. These are also created automatically in the
  scope of the installation of the domain controller master. The UCC
  client is then registered for the DHCP server and the configured IP
  address is assigned to the DHCP.
</para>

<para>
  UCS offers you the possibility of centrally managing the IP
  addresses and DNS/DHCP settings of a network in a network
  object in the LDAP. This can considerably facilitate the management of
  UCC clients by selecting the network object in
  <guimenu>Network</guimenu> input field: The next free IP address of
  the network and the DNS and DHCP settings are then adopted automatically.
</para>

<figure><title>Management of IP addresses through a network object</title>
 <graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/umc-network.png"/>
 </figure>

<para>
  During the installation of an UCS system, a network object with the
  name <emphasis>default</emphasis> is saved as standard, which can
  usually be used in normal cases. If, for example, several sites are
  to be managed, additional networks can be defined using the
  <guimenu>Networks</guimenu> wizard in the &ucsUMC;.
</para>
<para>
  The DHCP configuration is then also performed via the UMC. The
  network properties of UCC clients can be centrally specified per
  subnetwork. The settings can be set via the UMC's
  <guimenu>DHCP</guimenu> wizard. The DHCP service of the current
  domain must be selected. The selection list which opens then shows
  the subnetwork object, which can be opened with a click. The
  following properties can be specified under
  <guimenu>Policies</guimenu> amongst others:
  <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara><emphasis>DNS</emphasis> allows the assignment
	of one or more name servers</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><emphasis>Routing</emphasis> allows the
	assignment of a default gateway. This must be set to ensure proper routing!</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><emphasis>Lease time</emphasis> allows
	configuration of a lease time for an IP address</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
  In the default setting, fixed IP addresses are assigned and only to
  clients registered in the LDAP.
</para>
<para>
  The DHCP administration also offers numerous, extensive configuration options,
  which are generally, however, not required in UCC
  client operation. They are described in the DHCP section in the UCS
  manual <xref linkend="ucs-manual"/>.
</para>
</section>


<section id="rollout:bootpolicy">
<title>Configuration of the PXE server in a multi-server environment</title>
<para>
  The rollout of UCC systems usually occurs via PXE (see <xref linkend="rollout:imagerollout"/>). If
  UCC is operated in a single server environment the server distributing the IP adresses to the
  clients is identical to the PXE server providing the UCC images for installation.
</para>
<para>
  If UCC is used in a distributed environment, there may be DHCP servers not serving as PXE servers. In
  that case the UCS server distributing the UCC images needs to be configured through a
  <guimenu>DHCP Boot</guimenu> policy. Please see the UCS manual for additional information
  <xref linkend="ucs-manual-pxeboot"/>.
</para>
</section>

<section id="rollout:imagerollout">
<title>Rollout of images</title>
<para>
  The image with which a UCC client is operated is configured in the
  &ucsUMC; in the <guimenu>Images</guimenu> tab on UCC computer
  objects. All the UCC images registered in the UCS management
  system are available for selection. The registration is effected
  with join scripts during the installation of the image, see <xref
  linkend="installation:imagemanagement:download"/>.
</para>
<para>
  The &ucsUMC; can also be used to edit several objects at once, which
  permits the assignment of images to several computers at once. This
  is documented in the UCS manual <xref linkend="ucs-manual-multiedit"/>.
</para>

<figure><title>Assigning the desktop image to a UCC client</title>
 <graphic scalefit="1" width="60%" fileref="illustrations/ucc-assign-image.png"/>
 </figure>

<para>
  UCC clients can be operated in three different installation modes,
  which can be assigned via the <guimenu>Boot variant</guimenu> field:
  <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara><guimenu>Live boot</guimenu> Here the image is
	started via PXE and mounted via NFS. The client must be configured
	for PXE boot in the BIOS. Technically, all UCC systems are always
	treated as having read/write storage media: If an image is mounted from a
	source which itself only allows readonly access (from a live DVD or as
	in this case from a NFS share), an OverlayFS file system is employed:
	All the write changes are cached in the system memory and are lost when the computer is
	switched off. Thin clients are also always run with an overlayfs
	for a local installation, further information can be found under
	<xref linkend="rollout:overlayfs"/>.</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem>
		<para><guimenu>Image boot with update check / Initial
				installation</guimenu> This mode is used for two purposes:
		</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><simpara>The initial installation of a UCC client</simpara></listitem>
	  <listitem><simpara>For updates of UCC systems to a new UCC image</simpara></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>
	If there are no partitions present, the system is partitioned.
	After the installation of the image, the system is joined into the
	UCS domain. If this boot variante is used on an existing UCC
	installation, is is detected whether the installed image differs
	from the image to be installed. If that is the case, the
	system, the UCC system partition is overwritten. In this case, no
	new partitioning occurs.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><guimenu>Image boot without update
	check</guimenu> In this boot mode, the locally installed image
	is started and no check for a newly available image
	performed. Following an installation performed with <guimenu>Image boot
	with update check / Initial installation</guimenu>, the system returns to
	this boot mode automatically.</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
  The <guimenu>Additional boot parameter</guimenu> input field can be
  used to add any parameters to the initial RAM disk, which performs
  the installation/rollout. Two preconfigured options are:
  <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara><emphasis>debugshell=y</emphasis> : If an error
	occurs during installation of the image, a shell opens in which
	the problem can be analysed further.</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><emphasis>verbose=y</emphasis> : The shell scripts
	of the initial RAM disk are started with the parameter "-x", with
	which the current control flow can be better monitored (useful
	for debugging).</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>
</section>

<section id="rollout:partitioning">
<title>Partitioning / separation of user and system data</title>
<para>
  On the systems installed with images, user-specific data such as the
  home of the users must be stored separately from the system data on
  another partition. This is the case in the default partition configuration.
</para>
<para>
  The partitioning scheme is specified in the images configuration, see
  <xref linkend="imagegen:params"/>.
</para>
<para>
  The <guimenu>Repartitioning for installed systems</guimenu> option
  on the <guimenu>Images</guimenu> tab of a UCC client in the computer
  management of the &ucsUMC; forces repartitioning of a
  system. A prompt must be confirmed before the partitioning begins.
</para>
<caution>
	<para>
	Existing user data on a /home partition on a system are
	also deleted!
	</para>
</caution>
<para>
  The GNU Parted version used in Ubuntu 12.04 has a bug, which means that
  the <emphasis>bootable</emphasis> flag of the protective MBR disappears when you edit a
  partition. This can cause boot problems with some BIOS
  implementations. This bug does not occur during partitioning in UCC
  as the flag is set manually via a script
  (<command>set-bootable-flag-on-protective-mbr</command>). As such, manual
  partitioning should be avoided or the script be executed after partitioning.
</para>

<para>
  It is also possible to perform completely new partitioning schemes - e.g. an encrypted hard drive -
  with an adapted partitioning script, see <xref linkend="imagegen:crypto"/>).
</para>

</section>

<section id="rollout:automatic">
<title>Configuration of a fully automated rollout</title>
<para>
  The rollout of UCC systems can be completely automated so that user
  interaction is no longer necessary. Once all the clients to be
  rolled out have been created in the UCS management system (see
  <xref linkend="rollout:administrationumc"/>), the following steps
  are necessary:
</para>

<para>
  An image must be generated in which the interactive confirmation of
  the partitioning is disabled. This can be achieved by setting the
  option <emphasis>continuation_prompt</emphasis> to
  <emphasis>false</emphasis> (see <xref
  linkend="imagegen:params"/>).
</para>

<para>
  Then the credentials of a user need to be stored in the image,
  which is authorised to join clients in the domain (the user must be
  a member of the <emphasis>Domain Admins</emphasis> and <emphasis>DC Backup Hosts</emphasis> groups for
  this). For security reasons, this user should only be created during
  the rollout and then removed or disabled after the rollout.
</para>

<para>
  These credentials are now saved in the image with the tool
  <command>ucc-image-set-join-information</command>. The parameter
  <emphasis>-i</emphasis> is used to specify an image and the join
  account and its password are interactively prompted.
</para>

<para>
  The clients are then rolled out fully automatically without user
  interaction.
</para>

</section>

<section id="rollout:domainjoins">
<title>Domain join of UCC systems</title>
<para>
  Only UCC clients, which are joined into a UCS domain can be
  centrally configured. Unjoined clients can still be used for special
  setups like live systems or demo points.
</para>

<para>
  The domain join is typically performed in the scope of the rollout
  via PXE (see <xref linkend="rollout:imagerollout"/>). The domain
  join can also be subsequently performed by
  running <command>univention-join</command>. The subsequent domain join
  cannot be performed via SSH, but should instead be run via a
  local login or, if virtualization is employed, via VNC. The system
  must be restarted after the join.
</para>

<para>
  UCS installations, in which the &ucsMaster; was installed in a release older than 2.3 still use
  MD5 as the hashing algorithm for the SSL certificates. Later releases use SHA1 has the hashing
  algorithm. UCC clients cannot join a domain still using MD5 hashes. The necessary steps to migrate
  a UCS domain from MD5 to SHA1 are documented in the Univention Support Database (<ulink
  url="http://sdb.univention.de/1150"/>).
</para>

</section>

<section id="rollout:iso">
<title>Rollouts using an ISO image</title>
<para>
  While the standard rollout mechanism for UCC systems is PXE-based,
  it is also possible to perform installations using ISO images, which
  can be written to USB sticks, DVDs or BluRays.
</para>
<para>
  The images are available at
  <ulink url="http://ucc-images.software-univention.de/download/ucc-images/"/>.
</para>
<para>
  The client to be installed should be created in the UMC computer
  management first (see <xref linkend="rollout:administrationumc"/>).
</para>
<para>
  After the image has been written to disk and the boot medium is
  started, a boot menu appears. Here, <guimenu>UCC - Image boot with
  update check / Initial installation</guimenu> needs to be selected
  and the <emphasis>e</emphasis> key pressed. Then the boot options need to
  be modified from <emphasis>ucc=update</emphasis> to
  <emphasis>ucc=rollout</emphasis>. If the client already contains a
  partitioning, which needs to be replaced
  <emphasis>repartition=y</emphasis> needs to be added.
</para>

<section id="rollout:iso:xen">
<title>UCC installation as Xen Guest</title>
<para>
  To install an UCC ISO image in a Xen DomU, the DomU must be configured to be
  fully virtualized (HVM). On an UCS System with a virtual machine manager the operating system option
  'Other' has to be used <xref linkend="ucs-manual-uvmm"/>.
  Please note that the official UCC desktop image uses a kernel that supports pvops, so I/O performance
  is that of a paravirtualized guest when pvops is supported by Dom0. On an official thinclient image
  another kernel with pvops support can be installed, e.g. linux-image-generic-pae. More information
  about pvops can be found at <ulink url="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Paravirtualization_%28PV%29"/>.
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section id="rollout:persistent">
<title>Persistently stored system settings</title>
<para>
  System data which must be preserved during an update (e.g., the join
  status) are saved separately from the system data and automatically restored
  after updates. These files and selected &ucsUCR; variables are registered in
  the UCR variables <envar>ucc/persistent/files</envar> and
  <envar>ucc/persistent/ucr</envar>. Important standard UCC settings
  are preconfigured automatically and can be expanded for local
  adaptations.
</para>
</section>

<section id="rollout:overlayfs">
<title>OverlayFS on thin clients</title>
<para>
  The CompactFlash storage media typically integrated in thin clients
  are only designed for a limited number of write operations.
</para>

<para>
  Thin clients are thus started in UCC with an OverlayFS file system
  so that all write accesses on the storage media of a booted system
  are only performed in the system memory and not written to the hard
  drive. All the write changes are thus lost once the thin client is
  switched off. This does not pose any problems for access to terminal
  services, as all the user activities are performed on the respective
  terminal servers. The standard write access is selectively enabled
  for individual operations such as the installation of new UCC images
  or subsequent installation of software.
</para>

<para>
  If a thin client uses storage media which allows
  permanent write access, the Overlayfs can also be disabled by
  setting the &ucsUCR; variable <envar>ucc/thinclientoverlayfs</envar> to
  <emphasis>false</emphasis>. In addition
  <emphasis>mount=rw</emphasis> must be set in under
  <guimenu>Images - >Additional boot parameter</guimenu> in the
  computer management module of the &ucsUMC;.
</para>
