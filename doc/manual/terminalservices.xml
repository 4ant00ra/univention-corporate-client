  <title>Terminal services with UCC</title>

  <para>
	In addition to the operation of stationary UCC clients, UCC also supports
	access to terminal services. Login is supported to:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><simpara>UCC terminal servers via the RDP protocol (based on XRDP)</simpara></listitem>
	  <listitem><simpara>Windows terminal services via the RDP protocol</simpara></listitem>
	  <listitem><simpara>Citrix XenApp</simpara></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
	There are three possibilities for configuring access to a terminal service:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><simpara>
		An interactive selection of the session by the user during login to LightDM (see <xref
		linkend="logins:sessions"/>)
	  </simpara></listitem>

	  <listitem><simpara>
		Automatic session selection where login is performed with a guest user. In this case, no
		login dialogue is shown (see <xref linkend="logins:autologin"/>).
	  </simpara></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <section id="terminalservices:xrdp">
	<title>UCC terminal services based on XRDP</title>
	<para>
	  UCC integrates terminal services provided via XRDP, i.e., the KDE Linux desktop is provided
	  via the RDP protocol.
	</para>

	<section id="terminalservices:xrdp:installation">
	  <title>Installation</title>

	  <para>
	  </para>

	  <para>
		UCC terminal servers are installed with the UCC desktop image. The setup is described in
		<xref linkend="umc:manageucc"/>. The <package>univention-xrdp</package> package must also be
		installed on the desktop image. There is a UCC software policy linked to the container
		<uri>cn=computers, cn=ucc-xrdpserver</uri> (see <xref
		linkend="config:softwareupdates"/>), i.e., if the computer object is created in the container,
		the package is installed automatically during the rollout of the UCC system.
	  </para>

	  <caution>
	  	<para>
		  An XRDP terminal server needs to be restarted once following the installation to be able
		  to initialise additional PulseAudio drivers correctly!
	  	</para>
	  </caution>

	</section>

	<section id="terminalservices:xrdp:access">
	  <title>Accessing XRDP terminal services</title>

	  <para>
		The access of an XRDP terminal server from a UCC thin client via the RDP protocol is
		described in <xref linkend="terminalservices:rdp"/>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		If the forwarding of storage devices is enabled, they appear in the user's home directory in
		the <filename class="directory">~/xrdp_client</filename> directory. Forwarding of sound output in terminal sessions is also
		possible. This requires a sound card to be present or emulated on the XRDP terminal server.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		Access to the XRDP terminal server from other clients is also supported (e.g., Windows PCs,
		Mac OS X or thin clients with third-party operating systems). For these clients it is
		sufficient to configure the IP address or hostname of the XRDP server and perform a login
		with a user from the UCS domain. An XRDP login screen is provided for the login from
		external devices. It is not necessary to specify a domain when logging on to an XRDP
		terminal server.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		Password changes are currently not yet supported when logging in from an external device. If
		the password has expired, the login will fail. Password changes are performed in the login
		manager LightDM when logging in from UCC thin clients.
	  </para>
	</section>


	<section id="terminalservices:xrdp:kdeprofile">
	  <title>KDE desktop in UCC terminal services</title>
	  <para>
		As standard, UCC uses a KDE profile optimised for remote operation on terminal servers. It
		disables e.g. update notifications. The use of this profile can be disabled per UCC terminal
		server by setting the &ucsUCRV; on the XRDP terminal server <envar>ucc/session/remote/profile</envar> to
		<literal>false</literal> (see <xref linkend="config:ucr"/>).
	  </para>

	<title>Windows terminal services (RDP)</title>
	<para>
	  UCC supports login to Windows 2003/2008/2012-based Windows terminal servers via the RDP
	  protocol. The Windows terminal servers can be joined in the UCS domain or alternatively the access
	  can be performed against an external domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The login is performed via the <emphasis>RDP</emphasis> session script which uses the
	  NeutrinoRDP client (a fork of the FreeRDP code base). The password entered
	  by the user during login to LightDM is cached by a PAM module and automatically provided to
	  NeutrinoRDP, i.e., it is not necessary to enter it again when logging in to the terminal server.
	</para>

	<para>
		The RDP client <application>Remmina</application> is provided as a client with which an RDP connection can be
	  configured and started on the desktop.
	</para>

	<section id="terminalservices:rdp:setup">
	  <title>Installation</title>

		<para>
		  USB storage devices (USB sticks or CD/DVD drives), which can be inserted in the thin
		  client, can be passed through to the RDP session. This is done by enabling the

	<para>
	  Citrix Receiver version 13.2 is included in the UCC thinclient image.
	  Other Citrix Receiver versions may be included manually in a thinclient image.
	  It must be downloaded for the 32 bit Intel architecture as a DEB file using the download link provided

	<para>
	  The Citrix Receiver uses <filename>/dev/random</filename> as a

<section id="terminalservices:citrix:flash">
  <title>Accelerating the playback of Flash videos</title>
  <para>
	The Citrix Receiver offers the possibility of optimising the playback of Flash videos: instead of
	streaming the video on the server and transmitting every image, the video is transmitted to the
	client and played locally in the terminal session. This requires the installation of the Flash
	plugin on the UCC client (the package is called <package>adobe-flashplugin</package>).
  </para>

  <para>
	  To supress the popup question to optimize flash playback, a UCR policy should e.g. set 
	  <envar>ucc/xenapp/wfclient/flashsetting</envar> to <literal>HDXFlashUseFlashRemoting=Always</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
	In the default setting the Flash version on the client and the Flash version on the Citrix server
	need to be identical. Releases of Adobe Flash later than 11.2 are no longer available for Linux.
	The version check can be disabled on the Citrix server. For this a registry key needs to
	be added on the Citrix server in the location <guimenu>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &ar; Software &ar;
	Wow6432Node &ar; Citrix &ar;  HdxMediaStreamForFlash &ar; Server &ar; PseudoServer</guimenu>. The new key
must be created as a <classname>dword</classname>, named <property>FlashPlayerVersionComparisonMask</property> and set to
	<literal>0</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
	To verify the local Flash playback, you can play a Flash video on the Citrix server and query
	the process list on the UCC client using <command>ps aux</command>. If the Flash redirection is
	working correctly, you should see a process named <systemitem class="process">FlashContainer.bin</systemitem>.
