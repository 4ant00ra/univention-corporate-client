desc: |
  This erratum fixes two bugs:
  * For ucc clients with UCS@school integration 
    dns_lookup_kdc is used in krb5.conf (by unsetting the 
    UCR variable kerberos/kdc in the UCS@SCHOOL integration
    join script)
  * The join script 80univention-ucc-ucsschool-integration.inst 
    no longer fails in UCS@school single server environments.
