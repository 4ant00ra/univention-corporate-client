note:
desc: |
 Full partition devices (like /dev/sda or /dev/sdb) on removable USB devices
 are longer mounted on to thin clients (UCC desktop systems are not
 affected), since this could lead to delays in freeing unmounted devices
 in terminal services like RDP or XenApp. The old behaviour was be restored
 by setting the UCR variable ucc/mount/fullpartition to true.
