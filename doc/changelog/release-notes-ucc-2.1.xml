		UCS installations, in which the &ucsMaster; was installed in a release older than 2.3 still
		use MD5 as the hashing algorithm for the SSL certificates. Later releases use SHA1 as the
		hashing algorithm. UCC clients cannot join a domain still using MD5 hashes. The necessary
		steps to migrate a UCS domain from MD5 to SHA1 are documented in the Univention Support
		Database (<ulink url="http://sdb.univention.de/1150"/>).

		  <title>Announcing discontinuation of XRDP terminal services for UCC 3</title>
		  <para>
			With the release of Univention Corporate Client 2.1 Univention announces the discontinuation of XRDP terminal services on UCC for the next major release UCC 3.0.
			This does not affect functionality and support for XRDP UCC terminal services on UCC 2.

		<title>User switches using <command>su</command></title>
		<para>
		  Switching from one non-root user account to another non-root user account with the
		  <command>su</command> command doesn't work. Switching to the root account is not affected.
		  The underlying bug cannot be easily fixed as it would lead to invasive changes. As a
		  workaround it is possible to first switch to root and then switch to the user account, e.g.

		  <programlisting>
$ su root
$ su testuser
		  </programlisting>

	  	<title>RDP logins and PAM home mounts after a password change at LightDM</title>
	  	<para>
		  If the user password is changed during the login at the LightDM Login Manager (e.g.,
		  because the <guimenu>Change password on next login</guimenu> user option is activated or
		  because a password has expired), the password change is effected via Kerberos. This
		  Kerberos password change is not "visible" for PAM modules executed after authentication. 
		  The RDP session script and the PAM module for mounting the home directory via CIFS,
		  however, access the cached password and, as a result, the login fails the first time. The
		  correct password is then available for the second login attempt.
