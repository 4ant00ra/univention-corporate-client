      a device but no disk inserted. this allows cdpinger to run again.

  135 Vagrant Cascadian 2010-02-10
      cdpinger: report syslog messages for "disk detected" and "tray

      Refactor ltspfs_entry and cdpinger code to better handle CDROMs

  130 Gideon Romm	2010-02-10
      Remove cdpinger pid file when cdrom is removed, since apparently
      cdpinger will commit suicide on its own upon device removal and
      we would like cdpinger to start up again upon reinsertion of the
      cdrom drive.

  129 Gideon Romm	2010-02-09
      Try to avoid multiple parallel calls to pgrep by writing a pid

      rdesktop, and kiosk scripts.

  123 Scott Balneaves	2010-01-27

      /media/$username created as 0750 instead of 0755.  This is
      functionally equivalent because fuse was preventing other users
      from going in there anyway.  vagrantc + warren analysis: 0700
      doesn't work because the non-root user still has to access inside.
      0770 is undesirable because we don't want the non-root user to be
      able to write arbitrary things in there.	(/media/$username is owned
      by root and managed by lbmount, while mounts inside that are owned
      by the user.)  0750 is thus desirable by process of elimination.
